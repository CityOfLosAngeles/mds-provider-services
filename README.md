# mds-provider-services

Services for working with [MDS `provider`][provider] data, built as runnable Docker containers.

These services are implemented via [`mds-provider`](https://github.com/CityofSantaMonica/mds-provider),
a general-purpose Python library for working with MDS Provider data.

## Local development

Requires both [Docker][docker] and [Docker Compose][compose].

`docker-compose` commands below should be run from the root of this repository,
where the `docker-compose.yml` file lives.

### Container organization

The containers are organized around specific functions. More detailed explanation
can be found in a container's `README.md`.

| container | description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| [`client`](client/) | [pgAdmin4][pgadmin] web client |
| [`fake`](fake/) | Generate fake MDS `provider` data for testing and development |
| [`initdb`](initdb/) | Initialize an MDS `provider` database |
| [`load`](load/) | Load a database from `provider` data files |
| [`pull`](pull/) | Pull data from `provider` API endpoints |
| [`server`](server/) | Local [postgres][postgres] database server |

## Getting Started

### 1. Create an `.env` file

Copy the sample and edit as necessary. Compose automatically sources this
environment file for `docker-compose` commands.

```bash
$ cp .env.sample .env
```

### 2(a). Start (all of the) containers

Build and start all of the containers according to the dependencies outlined in
[`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml).

```bash
$ docker-compose up -d --build --force-recreate
```

### 2(b). Start (individual) containers

See the `README.md` file in each container folder for more details.

### 3. Stop the containers

Shutdown and completely erase the containers and their resources.

```bash
$ docker-compose down
```
